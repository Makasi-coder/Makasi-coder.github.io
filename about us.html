	<h1>WHAT WE BELIEVE</h1>

    <p>
		<span class="bold">THE BIBLE</span><br>
	The Bible is God’s Word to all people. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. Because it was inspired by God, the Bible is truth without any mixture of error and is completely relevant to our daily lives.

	Deuteronomy 4:1-2  Psalm 119:11, 89, 105  Isaiah 40:8 Matthew 22:29 John 5:39; 16:13-15; 17:17 Romans 15:4 2 Timothy 3:15-17 Hebrews 1:1-2; 4:12 1 Peter 1:25  2 Peter 3:16</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bold">TRINITY</span><br>
	God has existed in relationship with Himself for all eternity. He exists as one substance in three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Although each member of the Trinity serves different functions, they each possess equal power and authority.

	Deuteronomy 6:4 Isaiah 61:1 Matthew 28:19 Mark 1:9-11 Luke 1:35 John 5:21-23; 14:10, 16 Romans 8:9-11  1 Corinthians 8:6  2 Corinthians 13:14  Hebrews 1:8-10  James 2:19</p>

	<p>
		<span class="bold">THE FATHER</span><br>
	God is great: He is all powerful, all knowing, ever present, unchanging, completely worthy of our trust, and above all, Holy. It is in Him that we live, move and exist. God is good. He is our Father. He is loving, compassionate, and faithful to His people and His promises.

	Exodus 3:14  Numbers 23:19  Leviticus 11:44-45; 19:2 Psalm 11:4-6 Malachi 3:6 John 3:16; 4:24; 5:26; 14:1 Acts 17:28 Romans 3:3-4</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bold">THE SON</span><br>
	Jesus Christ is completely human but, at the same time, completely God. He is the only plan for bringing people who are far from God back into a right relationship with God. He lived a perfect life, so that He could be a substitution for us in satisfying God’s demands for perfection. He defeated death in His resurrection so that we can have life.

	Isaiah 7:14; 53  Matthew 1:18-23; 3:17; 8:29; 14:33; 16:16; 28:5-6 Luke 22:70; 24:46-47 John 1:1, 14; 10:30; 11:25-27; 17:1-5 Acts 1:9; 2:22-24; 7:55-56 Romans 1:3-4; 3:23-26; 8:1-3; 10:4 1 Corinthians 8:6 2 Corinthians 5:19-21 Gal 4:4-5 Philippians 2:5-11 Colossians 1:15; 2:9 1 Timothy 2:5-6; 3:16</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bold">THE HOLY SPIRIT</span><br>
	The Holy Spirit’s presence assures us of our relationship with Christ. He guides believers into all truth and exalts Christ. He convicts people of their sin, God’s righteousness, and the coming judgment. He comforts us, gives us spiritual gifts, and makes us more like Christ.

	Genesis 1:2 Psalm 51:11; 139:7 ff. Isaiah 61:1-3 Joel 2:28-32 Mark 1:10 Luke 1:35; 4:1; 11:13; 12:12 John 15:26; 16:7-14 Acts 1:8; 2:1-4; 13:2 Romans 8:9-11, 14-16, 26-27 1 Corinthians 3:16 Ephesians 1:13-14 2 Peter 1:2 Revelation 22:17</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bold">THE ETERNITY</span><br>
	Man was created to exist forever. He will exist either eternally separated from God by sin or in union with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union with Him is Heaven. Heaven and Hell are places of eternal existence.

	John 3:16, 36 Romans 6:23 1 John 2:25; 5:11-13 Revelation 20:15</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bold">MAN</span><br>
	Man is made in the image of God and is the supreme object of His creation. Man was created to have fellowship with God but became separated in that relationship through sinful disobedience. As a result, man cannot attain a right relationship with God through his own effort. Every human personality is uniquely created, possesses dignity, and is worthy of respect and Christian love.

	Genesis 1:26-30; 2:7, 18-22; 3 Psalms 8:3-6; 32:1-5; 51:5 Isaiah 6:5 Jeremiah 17:5 Acts 17:26-31 Romans 1:19-32; 3:10-18, 23; 5:6; 6:6; 7:14-25 1 Corinthians 1:21-31; 15:19, 21-22 Ephesians 2 Colossians 1:21-22; 3:9-11</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bold">SALVATION</span><br>
	The blood of Jesus Christ, shed on the cross, provides the only way of salvation through the forgiveness of sin. Salvation occurs when people place their faith in the death and resurrection of Christ as sufficient payment for their sin. Salvation is a gift from God, and it cannot be earned through our own efforts.

	Isaiah 1:18; 53:5-6; 55:7 Matthew 1:21; 27:22-66, 28:1-6 Luke 1:68-69; 2:28-32 John 1:12; 3:16, 36; 5:24 Acts 2:21; 4:12; 16:30-31 Romans 1:16-18; 3:23-25; 5:8-10; 6 1 Corinthians 1:18 2 Corinthians 5:17-20 Galatians 2:20; 3:13 Ephesians 2:8-10 Philippians 2:12-13 Hebrews 9:24-28 Revelation 3:20</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bold">THE CHURCH</span><br>
	The Church is a local community of baptized believers unified through faith in Christ. It is committed to the teachings of Christ and obeying all of His commands, and it seeks to bring the Gospel to the world. The Church works together in love and unity, intent on the ultimate purpose of glorifying Christ.

	Matthew 16:18-19; 18:15-20 Acts 2:41-47; 5:11-14; 13:1-3; 14:23; 16:5; 20:28 1 Corinthians 7:17; 9:13-14; 12 Ephesians 1:22-23; 2:19-22; 3:10-12; 5:22-32 Colossians 1:18; 3:15 1 Timothy 4:14 1 Peter 5:1-4 Revelation 21:2-3
